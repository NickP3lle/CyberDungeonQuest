# PicoCTF

All the challenges are from [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/). The challenges are designed to be solved in order, but it's not a requirement.

## Notice

Many challenges require you to connect to a server using a port that is different for each user. Using my ports and my flags won't work for you.
