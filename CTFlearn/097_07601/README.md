1. Using the `strings` command we can see a fake flag `ABCTF{fooled_ya_dustin}`. We can also see that there could be some hidden files in the image.

2. We can use the `binwalk` command to extract the hidden files. The command is `binwalk -e AGT.png`.

3. We can use `strings` on the hidden files to find the flag `ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}`.
