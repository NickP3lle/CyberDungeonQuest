Despite what you may have heard, an acrostic

is a poem in which the first letter (or

syllable, or word) of each line spells out

a name, a message or the alphabet.

So, in this challenge, we use the

same idea to

encode (part of) the flag. Crazy, isn't it?

Maybe this is just a ruse to introduce a

beloved tool that you will

leverage several times during the CyberChallenge.IT

experience.

The flag can be obtained by enclosing the

hidden name, all lowercase, inside CCIT{...}; is

everything clear?

Excellent

Lovely

Fantastic!
