1. The challenge is clearly about RSA algorithm.

2. We can look for p and q factors on [factordb.com](http://factordb.com/) and decrypt the message.

3. The plaintext is a list of number that we can convert to ASCII characters.

4. Flag: `CCIT{d3crypt_0r_brut3f0rc3_m3?}`

All the code can be found in [solve.py](solution/solve.py).
