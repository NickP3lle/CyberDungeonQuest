# SpritzCTF

spritzCTF are CTFs created by the [Spritz Security and Privacy Research Group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/index.html) from University of Padua.
The CTFs were created for educational purposes and were meant to be used by students during the "Cybersecurity: Principles and Practices" course at University of Padua. I selected some of the most interesting challenges and created a repository to share them with the community.
